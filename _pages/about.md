I am Jasmine, a Ph.D candidate in Software Engineering working under the supervision of [Emad Shihab](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/emad-shihab.html) in the [DAS Lab](https://das.encs.concordia.ca/) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca) in Montreal, Canada. I am also part of [CREATE SE4AI](https://se4ai.org/), a training program funded by [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) that fills the major shortage in highly qualified personnel (HQP) that can develop, deploy and service AI-based software systems and equally provide the HQP with a solid background on ethical and social understanding of AI. 

During my undergraduate studies, I quickly learned that Software Engineering comes with a fair amount of frustration whether it comes from the steep learning curve of complex concepts, never ending CI builds, or the 1000 vulnerability alerts that follow an npm install. Therefore, research for me is a way to put my experience with these frustrations into practice, and find solutions to alleviate problems related to software performance and maintenance for developers by developers. Thus, I have a strong interest in the software supply chain, software engineering for AI, and large language models. 

I am currently working as an AI research intern at the [Ministère de la cybersécurity et du numérique du Québec](https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/ministere/cybersecurite-numerique)! 

Outside of research, I like spending my time walking my dog, reading (big Harry Potter fan), and playing video games (big Tetris fan).
